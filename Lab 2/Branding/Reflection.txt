My branding was inspired by the concept of intentional minimalism, focusing on the idea that clarity and purpose should drive every design choice. I chose a palette of red and beige to evoke a sense of professional trust and modern stability, accented by a single pop of electric amber for energy. The most challenging aspect of creating the logo was finding the balance between a unique, recognizable symbol and a shape simple enough to remain legible at small scales. Moving forward, I plan to integrate this visual identity across my digital portfolio and professional social media to create a cohesive narrative for my work. By maintaining this consistent aesthetic, I hope to establish a recognizable personal brand that signals quality and attention to detail to potential collaborators.
