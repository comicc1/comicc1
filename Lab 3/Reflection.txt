The square post was the easiest design to execute because its symmetrical frame allowed for a quick, impactful arrangement of the logo and core message. To maintain consistency, I strictly applied my red and beige color palette, using the beige as a neutral, sophisticated base and the red as a bold "call-to-action" color. I ensured readability and hierarchy by placing dark text against the light beige backgrounds and utilizing bold weight fonts for primary headers to catch the eye instantly. By varying the font sizes, I created a clear path for the viewer to follow, from the main headline down to the secondary details. I learned that creating social media graphics is a balancing act; you need enough "visual breathing room" so the bold red doesn't overwhelm the viewer. Ultimately, this project taught me that a limited color palette actually makes the design process faster and the final result look much more professional.
